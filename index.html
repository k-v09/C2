                <p>
                    I started programming in my freshman year of high school and for the rest of my time at school, I used this skill to aid my personal projects. I learned languages such as: python, c++, java, and julia; useful tools including: Unity, NumPy, and Flutter; and studied in the fields of: computer science, networking & telecommunications, and robotics. These skills all helped me to learn not only the knowledge to understand code, but also the mindset that it requires.

                <p>
                    Math is a central part of my life. I find the natural beauty of all forms of math awe inspiring. I enjoy researching and discovering math, which has led me to write and publish a few of my theorems

                <p>
                    Of all things listed here, music is the most important. It is a critical form of expression (whether that's personal or social). I learned my first instrument, drums, at age seven. After some time, learned many others like bass, guitar, piano, and most of the variations of those (organ, accordion, etc.).
