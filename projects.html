                    My longest-running project to date, I am constantly searching for and builing the perfect 
                    instrument. One that both makes entire sets of music and also works as a fully custom 
                    guitar pedal all while redefining what making music means to me.

                <h2>Reverse Fourier</h2>
                <p>
                    My first ever completed math project, the Reverse Fourier is a single formula which allows 
                    sin wave harmonic addition to be expressed as a single wave with sin(x) factored out. 
                    I'm not quite sure how useful it is, but I am sure that this will always have a special 
                    place in my heart.

                <p>
                    For my senior research project, I branched out from theoretical mathematics to theoretical 
                    physics. Though I have never been formally trained in relativity theory or quantum mechanics, 
                    I was determined to tackle a subject that not only falls into those fields, but also pushed 
                    the limits of what was achievable on my own. Clicking the thumbnail page will bring you to 
                    the shortened version of my paper "Instantaneous Interaction With Time."

                    The first challenge for my full-stack development program was for learning about writing and 
                    building stylized websites. This site about search engine optimization is a great reference 
                    for semantic HTML as well as a good base for how a website should look (at least in my mind 
                    haha).
